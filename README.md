# Car-Simulation-for-Pedestrian-Count
This was created for APSC200 in response to our team's decision to design a car that would be used to track the number of pedestrians at intersections. This hypothetical car counts the amount of pedestrians at intersections in order for the City to optimize street light and pedestrian walk timings during various times of the day. The simulation I created can be seen in the photo and the associated code can be seen in the proto1 file.
